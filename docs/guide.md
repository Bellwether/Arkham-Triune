# Overview

Arkham Triune is a puzzle game where you build the fictional city of Arkham Massachusetts by matching Tiles from the eldritch New England landscape. Matching a Triune of three or more Tiles upgrades into a single greater Tile, and thereby will your city grow! 

But Arkham is witch-haunted, and if you're to build a legacy you must trap the Monsters that will arrive to impede your progress with their sundry evils. 

Read on for details...

### How To Play

You'll build your city and environs by placing Tiles until you fill a 6x6 Map of 1920s New England, at which point your Arkham will be complete and you'll earn a Score for the quality of your creation. Tiles appear randomly, one after the other, with more valuable ones appearing less often.

Placing three matching Tiles beside each other forms a Triune, upgrading all the matched Tiles into a single, more valuable Tile of the same type. Matching also gives you Points and clears the Map for you to place more Tiles. Clearing the Map is vital, because the game ends once there are no more possible placements.

Occasionally a Monster will appear instead of a normal Tile. Once you place a Monster, it will move through the empty areas of your Map, preventing you from placing a Tile wherever it stands. The more Monsters that appear, the less of your Map will be free for building. You can, however, trap a Monster by surrounding it on all four sides with Tiles, forming a new Tile that can match other trapped Monsters.

In addition to scoring Points, high quality matches award Wisdom. You can spend your Wisdom to purchase Tiles and Magic that will help you complete Triunes or rid your Map of Monsters. Once you complete your Map, you will then earn a final award of both Points and Wisdom.

### Tiles

Tiles which appear for placement are randomly determined, with some more common than others. While you only need three Tiles to form a Triune, matching more (up to nine) earns more Points. Note that some monsters can cause a Tile to become Cursed, which will then exclude that Tile from matching in a Triune until you remove the curse.

The following groups of Tiles appear in Arkham Triune; the first-level Tiles able to upgrade up to four times as seen below:

Level 1 > Level 2 > Level 3 > Level 4 > Level 5
-----------------------------------------------
Willow Grove > Orchard > Farmstead > Plantation > Estate
Cottage > Cape Cod > Townhouse > Gabelfront > Georgian Manor
Mission > Chapel > Church > Perish Church > Cathedral
Union Center > Fraternal Hall > Masonic Lodge > Temple > Grand Lodge

While you always have a Tile queued for placement, you also have the ability to Suspend a Tile, reserving it for later. You may at any time swap your next Tile for your Suspended Tile, as often as you please. You can use the Suspended Tile to plan larger Triunes or save Magic for when it's needed most.

### Magic

On occasion a Magic Tile will appear. While placed like a normal Tile, Magic can produce powerful effects on the Map depending on how it's placed. The following Magic Tiles can appear:

Elder Sign
Destroys any Tile or Monster on which it's placed; if placed on cursed Tile, it removes the curse; if placed on an empty tile, nothing happens.

Silver Key
When placed, Creates a Triune with any other two or more matching Tiles; if several matches are possible, creates the most powerful Triune available; if no matches are possible, creates a Summoning Circle.

Mythos Tome
Replaces the next Tile queued with any Tile or Monster on which it's placed, allowing you to effectively reposition one Tile on the map; if placed on an empty tile, nothing happens.

### Monsters

From time to time, Monsters will appear to be placed just as normal Tiles. Once placed, however, they will move around your Map occupying empty spaces and preventing you from placing other Tiles. As more and more Monsters appear, Arkham will slowly fall to their control. You can remove a Monster by using an Elder Sign, or you can Trap it, transforming it into a matchable Tile.

To Trap a Monster, you must ensure it has nowhere to run and is surrounded by other, non-Monster, Tiles. Once trapped, the Monster will turn into a Summoning Circle. Three or more Summoning Circles match into a Triune, and can upgrade just as normal Tiles. If you can Trap three or more Monsters at once, you will both turn the Monsters into Summoning Circles, and immediately form a Triune!

Summoning Circles, however, can also be used by Monsters! If a Monster stands before one, there is a chance it will be transported through, appearing elsewhere on your Map and in the process upgrading to a more powerful Monster. The monsters, and their abilities, are as follows; note, only Cultists and Cats of Ulthar will appear for placement - other monsters arrive through Summoning Circles

Cultist
Moves around the Map and occupies space, thwarting your plans. Upgrades to a Witch.

Witch
Moves, and will occasionally curse another Tile, preventing it from forming Triunes. Upgrades to a Magus.

Magus
Curses Tiles, and teleports around the Map instead of moving, making them impossible to Trap. Upgrades to a Servitor.

Servitor
Curse Tiles, teleports around the Map, and occasionally summons more Cultists to the Map. Does not upgrade.

Cats of Ulthar
Moves around the Map and occupies space, but will not use Summoning Circles. The Cats of Ulthar are benign creatures that can help you, and when standing beside another Monster there's a chance they will devour that Monster and remove it from the Map. 

Summoning Circles have follow the upgrade path as seen below, and can ultimately be upgraded into a Great Old One, the most valuable Tile in Arkham Triune.

Level 1 > Level 2 > Level 3 > Level 4
-------------------------------------
Magic Pentagram > Magic Hexagram > Magic Heptagram > Great Old One

### Wisdom

You can visit the Starry Wisdom Bazaar at any time to spend the Wisdom you've earned. Wisdom will allow you to buy from a selection of Tiles, Monsters, and Magic that can serve you in a time of need. Because of the expense, you should use the Bazaar only when the need is great.

Wisdom is earned by forming Triunes, and by completing Maps. The amount awarded for your Map will depend on the Point value and arrangement of your Tiles. Once you've earned Wisdom you retain it until it's spent, and can use it on any Map you choose.

When shop at the Bazaar, your purchase replaces the next Tile queued and must be placed immediately.
